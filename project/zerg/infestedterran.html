							<br />
							When Zealots have a +1 weapon advantage versus Zerglings, they will kill Zerglings in two attacks instead of three. This makes Zealots very effecient against Zerglings until the zerg catches up in armor upgrades.<br />
							<br />
							Because of this, there are a handful of timing attack that take advantage of the effecient +1 weapon zealots, forcing the zerg to make spines, roaches, or some other unit than zerglings unless the zerg wants to trade inefficiently.</p>

						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab1"><p><br /><b>Effects of Infestation</b><br />
						<br />
						An infested terran is created when a terran is infected with the zerg hyper-evolutionary virus. The victim usually loses most of their intelligence and sanity, as their mind becomes consumed by the zerg. Most become stronger, faster, tougher, and develop the ability to burrow, as well as other typical zerg traits (the ability to quickly heal wounds, psionic sensitivity, and so forth). In addition, many infested terrans can explode, sacrificing themselves in a splash of toxic fluid. The resulting explosion has a ten meter radius, a large shockwave and can destroy small structures.<br />
						<br />
						In appearance, an infested terran looks "as if it had been redesigned by a madman who had too many spare parts left over from a variety of species." Growths and tentacles extrude from the body, with ruptured, sunken-in features and festering skin, albeit covered with carapace.</p>
						
						<p><br /><b>Types</b><br />
						<br />
						Before and during the Great War, as well as the following Brood War, most infested terrans acted as suicide bombers. Most were created from infesting command centers, which would then release the infested terrans.<br />
						<br />
						By the Second Great War, the zerg had developed new strains. One wore CMC Powered Combat Suit and carried gauss rifles. This strain, spawned by the infestor, had a short duration. Infestors are known to swallow infested terrans and regurgitate this strain later. Other strains relied on claws.<br />
						<br />
						During the conflict, various infested colonists were infested as well, and could be spawned through various means, often in large numbers from infested colonist huts. They could spawn in large numbers from cocoons popped by a very large queen.<br />
						<br />
						The heavily mutated aberration was developed by the war. They were spawned in essentially identical manners to the infested colonists.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab2"><p><br /><b>Early Zerg Experiments</b><br />
						<br />
						The zerg were successful in acquiring Sarah Kerrigan, a ghost who had been a member of the Sons of Korhal. The Overmind left her with the majority of her spirit, and she retained her intelligence and even some of her humanity.<br />
						<br />
						According to Captain Jon Dyre, a type of infested terran was used on Ursa, where infestation would leave them upon death and even appear normal while still infested. However, it should be noted that Dyre was under intense psychological stress at the time, and, upon his return to Ursa, lost his mind completely.</p>
						
						<p><br /><b>Kerrigan's Experiments</b><br />
						<br />
						The Queen of Blades developed an interest in recreating the experiment which created her sometime after the end of the Brood War. While she did not believe she could perfectly duplicate the results of her own change, which she considered "perfect", she still sought another infested terran such as herself hoping to get "close". Although she specifically sought out psychic terrans, most of her subjects were non-psionic.<br />
						<br />
						Her experiments were usually a failure, resulting in defects in intelligence and even mobility. She and a cerebrate believed the problem was a genetic compatibility issue, and the rare terrans who are compatible could result in another creature such as herself, albeit less powerful. The experiments were important enough to keep Kerrigan from engaging in combat with her enemies.<br />
						<br />
						Kerrigan's experiments finally succeeded with ex-mercenary and (former) crime lord, Ethan Stewart in 2503, although he was less "perfect" than herself, since she didn't want to create a rival. She intended to make him her consort. He quickly became one of her troop leaders.<br />
						<br />
						Kerrigan's experiments continued into the Second Great War. She infested some of the inhabitants of the "refugee world" of Meinhoff. There, the plague spread very quickly, and powerful aberrations (particularly large, bloated infested terrans) emerged, but the infested colonists fell prey to the high UV of Meinhoff's star during the day. Raynor's Raiders eventually defeated the plague.<br />
						<br />
						Agrian refugees left Meinhoff as carriers. Dr. Ariel Hanson, the refugees' liaison with Raynor's Raiders, began working on an unlikely cure. They settled on Haven but there was another outbreak; the protoss detected the infection and attacked.</p>
						
						<p><b><br />Lore Branches based on decisions in the Starcraft 2 Campaign. Option A</b><br />
						<br />
						Raynor's Raiders defend the colony against protoss purification. The outbreak was contained by quickly isolating the infected colonists.</p>
						
						<p><b><br />Lore Branches based on decisions in the Starcraft 2 Campaign. Option B</b><br />
						<br />
						Raynor's Raiders destroy the infested colonists. The outbreak swept through the Haven colony and was spread by virophages. Raynor's Raiders stopped outbreak by purging the infected colony bases. Hanson, meanwhile, had locked herself in the lab, desperately trying to work out a cure for the infestation. Raynor went in there and discovered that she had been infested. Dr. Hanson was still self-aware, even asking for death after being defeated.</p>
						
						<p><br /><b>Kaloth (Cerebrate) experiments.</b><br />
						<br />
						Kaloth, a zerg cerebrate who survived Kerrigan's purge of the cerebrates, conducted its own experiment of infesting humans as leaders. It acquired the corpse of former United Earth Directorate Vice Admiral Alexei Stukov and reanimated it, creating Infested Stukov. Stukov was able to interact with remnants of the old Terran Confederacy, who were engaging in high-tech research, including experimentation on infested terrans such as Morik.<br />
						<br />
						Stukov was put in charge of a weak brood on Braxis, a world he was already familiar with. Stukov was captured by a protoss and terran task force, led by Jim Raynor and Taldarin, who subjected him to an experiment of their own; they used protoss-devised nanites to reverse the infestation process, resulting in a living (and presumably fully human) Alexei Stukov.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab3"><p><br /><b>Terran Experiments</b><br />
						<br />
						The Terran Confederacy stored ardeon crystals tainted with zerg spores deep within the Jacobs Installation. Years later, a deserting soldier tried to steal the crystals, and discovered to his dismay that mere contact with a tainted crystal would quickly transform a terran into an infested terran. He was trapped within the facility.<br />
						<br />
						Remnant members of the Terran Confederacy worked at a secret facility on a means of "restoring faculties in Infested Terrans" and created Morik, a terran they performed horrible experiments on. They also studied a method of reanimating the dead using zerg infestation techniques.<br />
						<br />
						Significantly, one reanimated human, Infested Stukov, appeared in their facility. Along with studying the possibility of offspring from infested humans, a few files on such experiments were found; "Zerg/Human Genome Manipulation." "Saving Human Mental Faculties In Zerg/Human Hybridization Experiments." "Reanimation Using Zerg Infestation Techniques." "Offspring of Infested Humans." (Top secret file).<br />
						<br />
						The data was sold to the black market by the Kimeran Pirates. Most of the above experiments, including the possibility of offspring, had little to no chance of success. (Offspring of such unions, if they could even be created, would be dangerous captives and "irredeemably unbiddable.")<br />
						<br />
						"Mutate" is a term used for an infested terran whose intelligence has been preserved through the use of terran-devised nanites. A terran force captured a small zerg brood during the Brood War and forged mutates to be used against the zerg. These mutates were taken into the service of the Alliance.</p>
						
						<p><br /><b>Protoss Experiments</b><br />
						<br />
						The protoss are more interested in destroying infested terrans or reversing the process which created them than using them. To this end, the protoss developed a "radical nanotech serum" which could be used on infested terrans such as Infested Stukov. The serum was successfully administered to Stukov, who was freed from his infestation.</p>
						
						<p><br /><b>Xel'Naga Experiments</b><br />
						<br />
						A five-part xel'naga device had the potential of reversing the infestation of Sarah Kerrigan. Jim Raynor and Valerian Mengsk led a combined Raynor's Raiders/Terran Dominion force to Char, activating the device and restoring Kerrigan's humanity.</p></div>
