Dedicated to the pursuit of genetic perfection, the zerg relentlessly hunt down and assimilate advanced species across the galaxy, incorporating useful genetic code into their own.<br />								
						<br />
						Alongside the protoss and terrans, the zerg stand as one of the three dominant species of the Milky Way and are universally feared, hated and hunted as such. The Swarm in itself makes up a third of the power of the Koprulu Sector.</p></div>

						<div class="dblorepage firstdblorepage" id="dbloretab2"><p><br /><b>Creation of the Swarm</b><br />
						<br />
						The xel'naga discovered the original zerg on Zerus. The xel'naga gifted the zerg with the purity of essence, making them the counterparts of the protoss, gifted with the purity of form; the zerg and protoss were intended to eventually merge to perpetuate the xel'naga lifecycle. The xel'naga created the Overmind to control the zerg and prevent a repeat of the protoss' Aeon of Strife. The Overmind oversaw the zerg's rapid evolution, created the cerebrates, and divided the Swarm into broods.<br />
						<br />
						The Overmind's purpose was subverted by the Dark Voice; the Swarm drove away the xel'naga, and embarked on an interstellar journey toward Aiur, the protoss homeworld, to forcibly assimilate the protoss. The Overmind was aware, but unable to resist, the Dark Voice's influence. The Overmind knew the Dark Voice's ultimately goal would destroy the zerg.<br />
						<br />
						The Dark Voice sponsored its own protoss-zerg hybridization program. The first hybrids were ready by the end of the Brood War.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab3"><p><br /><b>The Great War</b><br />
						<br />
						Having assimilated multiple species and evolved during the journey, the Swarm arrived at the Koprulu Sector near the Protoss Empire. The Overmind ordered the assimilation of the terrans; their psionic potential was needed to fight the protoss. The protoss detected the zerg, learned of their xel'naga origins, and dispatched the Koprulu Expeditionary Force under Executor Tassadar to deny the zerg a foothold.<br />
						<br />
						The Great War broke out with the zerg invasion of the terran worlds. Protoss purification, and terran internal strife, failed to contain the invasion. The terran rebel group, the Sons of Korhal, used and manipulated the invasion to overthrow the Terran Confederacy and form the Terran Dominion. The zerg captured Sarah Kerrigan at the Battle of Tarsonis and withdrew to Char to transform her into the Queen of Blades. The Overmind intended Kerrigan to succeed it as the Swarm's leader, freeing the zerg from the Dark Voice. It had no concern over the other races of the galaxy.<br />
						<br />
						The zerg were attacked on Char by the protoss; a renegade Tassadar joined forces with Prelate Zeratul, a Dark Templar, on Char. Zeratul, wielding the Dark Templar's power of the Void, permanently slew Zasz, the chief cerebrate. This created a brief mental link between the Prelate and the Overmind, through which the Overmind learned the exact location of Aiur. Kerrigan remained on Char while the Swarm invaded Aiur.<br />
						<br />
						Resistance against the zerg invasion was hampered by the protoss Conclave's overconfidence and a short protoss civil war. The planet was devastated. The Overmind relocated to Aiur, where it was slain by the protoss. The protoss subsequently withdrew to Shakuras, the Dark Templar homeworld.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab4"><p><br /><b>The Brood War</b><br />
						<br />
						The Overmind's death left the Swarm divided bwtween the cerebrate Daggoth and Infested Kerrigan. Daggoth initiated creation of the second Overmind. Kerrigan sought to kill the Overmind before it could mature and resume control over the entire Swarm and her. The zerg civil was complicated by the arrival of the United Earth Directorate Expeditionary Fleet in the Koprulu Sector; the UED overthrew the Terran Dominion, and captured the second Overmind with the intent of using the zerg to maintain control over the Sector. The UED used the Psi Disrupter to fragment opposing zerg.<br />
						<br />
						Kerrigan manipulated both anti-UED terrans and the protoss to destroy the Psi Disrupter, break UED control over the Sector, and slay the Overmind, thus bringing the entire Swarm under her control. Zerg betrayal dissolved the alliances of convenience. The reformed Terran Dominion, UED remnants, and protoss attempted, and failed, to oust Kerrigan. The war ended with all sides withdrawing to rebuild[25]; the zerg remained in control of previously infested worlds.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab5"><p><br /><b>Interbellum</b><br />
						<br />
						For the next four years, the Swarm avoided outright conflict with the terrans and protoss while slowly expanding and evolving. The remaining cerebrates died and were replaced by brood mothers.<br />
						<br />
						As the first hybrids became active, signs of the Dark Voice's machinations reached Kerrigan. While searching for clues about the hybrids, Zeratul discovered Kerrigan was essential to prevent the Swarm from fulfilling the Dark Voice's apocolyptic plans; the dark templar instructed Jim Raynor, of Raynor's Raiders, to ensure Kerrigan's survival.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab6"><p><br /><b>The Second Great War</b><br />
						<br />
						The Second Great War began with the Swarm's invasion of terran space in search of a xel'naga device. Various terran groups used the upheaval to their own ends. Raynor's Raiders fomented rebellion against the Terran Dominion and, on behalf of Prince Valerian Mengsk's Möebius Foundation, recovered the device before the Swarm.<br />
						<br />
						A joint Raiders and Dominion attacked Char and used the device to deinfest Kerrigan. Much of the Swarm was destroyed in the resulting internecine strife. Queens assumed control of the remainder, competing with each other and rejecting Kerrigan's authority. Kerrigan embarked on a campaign to reunite the Swarm under her leadership.</p></div>

						<div class="dblorepage firstdblorepage" id="dbloretab7"><p><br />A great deal of information has been ascertained as to the nature of zerg physiology and psychology, such as through the Terran Confederacy's Project Bellwood. All zerg breeds are efficient killers and/or possess abilities that will aid the Swarm in the destruction of its enemies.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab8"><p><br /><b>Physiology</b><br />
						<br />
						The zerg as a whole are extremely tough, tenacious, and deadly. Their natural armor and weaponry is comparable to modern technology in terms of toughness and armor-piercing capabilities. The zerg are extremely resistant to chemical agents, but their biological nature still renders them vulnerable to concentrated radiation, such as sigma radiation.<br />
						<br />
						All zerg strains are capable of operating in a variety of environments, including the vacuum of space. Zerg must eat and rest, but do not require extended hours of sleep and have no set periods of inactivity. Left unchecked, zerg multiply at an alarming rate. Zerg do not die of old age.<br />
						<br />
						Most zerg ground strains are also capable of burrowing and digging through virtually any surface, using groups of tiny muscles that vibrate at a low frequency and grind dirt and stone along their way, allowing them to "swim through the ground". This ability made them extremely deadly in ambush situations, as many terran or protoss forces suffered losses when suddenly being surrounded by a mass of enemy zerg units. Zerg also tend to travel underground to attack enemies by surfacing a nydus worm.<br />
						<br />
						Before hatching, a specimen has two cell types in general: Type A creates different mutations, while B cells hunt them to feed their own procreation (probably, the same is applied reversely). Upon hatching, the specimen of a certain strain is a result of the Darwin's theory of evolution on a cellular level; it is made of the strongest strain mutations that survived.<br />
						<br />
						Zerg possess remarkable regenerative capabilities. Their alpha amino acids possess unique R groups that allow dead cell matter to be combined with normal proteins to create new cells. Under normal circumstances, zerg may regenerate indefinitely; a radically changing cell structure is a by-product of the process, as well as high quantity of energy in the process. Given time, even a gravely wounded zerg will return to full health. Thus, a zerg colony remains viable if even one creature or structure survives. Few zerg survive for more than a few minutes in a given battle, but those that do evolve during the battle itself, becoming more powerful every hour. The zerg constantly study their enemies and adapt accordingly.<br />
						<br />
						Zerg structures are essentially giant organs and draw sustenance from creep, a thick carpet-like substance that integrates a colony's structures as one macro-organism.<br />
						<br />
						Like terrans and protoss, zerg genetic material consists of DNA, seemingly in the shape of a double helix. However, when a zerg strain's DNA evolves, it becomes less flexible.<br />
						<br />
						The zerg like to pit themselves against harsh climates, using a planet's harsh conditions to further their own evolution. In regards to assimilating the genetic material of other species, the zerg were initially very selective, assimilating only strong species at the top of their food chains and erradicating 'lesser species' lest they corrupt the purity of the zerg genome. Under Kerrigan, the situation changed, and the zerg were willing to assimilate any material they came across.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab9"><p><br /><b>Psychology</b><br />
						<br />
						It has been difficult for observers to determine the full extent of the zerg intelligence, but it is clear that they are a very cunning species, and they are capable of higher reasoning. Although they do not utilize technology, they demonstrate a clear understanding of it, and have been known to open airlocks and doorways in colonies that they have raided. As a group they also react intelligently to attacks and are adept at tactical combat. On an individual basis, though, the zerg seem to be hardly more than savage animals with little or no concern for self-preservation.<br />
						<br />
						The amount of control exerted over a zerg force also impacts on their intelligence. Without this control, the zerg will become little more than animals, attacking everything on sight, at times, even their own kind.<br />
						<br />
						Zerg have the ability to sense psychic power and, being sensitive to it, often respond to it (to the point of rendering themselves temporarily out of the control of a leader) and seek it out. This ability has a greater range than that of wranglers, weakly psychic terrans employed to find other psychics.<br />
						<br />
						Zerg can be "lobotomized" to lose contact with the Zerg Swarm. The Terran Dominion conducted this experiment as early as 2500, using zerglings to seek psychic terrans.</p></div>
						
						<div class="dblorepage" id="dbloretab10"><p><br />The zerg are able to create rifts into warp space to transport themselves at faster-than-light speeds. These rifts have been utilized multiple times.</p></div>
